# Revenue Channel Insights by PyMC

## Channel Performance Analysis Using Bayesian Modeling

A company invests in multiple channels for branding and revenue generation but struggles to identify which channel performs the best or worst. By applying **Bayesian modeling**, we can address this issue by leveraging **prior beliefs**, **likelihood functions**, and deriving **posterior distributions**. Tools like **PyMC** make it straightforward to perform these calculations.

### Bayesian Framework

In Bayesian analysis, we update our beliefs (priors) about a channel’s performance based on observed data (likelihood) to calculate the posterior distribution:

P(θ∣data)\=P(data∣θ)⋅P(θ)P(data)P(\\theta | \\text{data}) = \\frac{P(\\text{data} | \\theta) \\cdot P(\\theta)}{P(\\text{data})}P(θ∣data)\=P(data)P(data∣θ)⋅P(θ)​

Where:

-   P(θ∣data)P(\\theta | \\text{data})P(θ∣data): Posterior probability of performance for a channel.
-   P(data∣θ)P(\\text{data} | \\theta)P(data∣θ): Likelihood of observing the data given a channel's performance.
-   P(θ)P(\\theta)P(θ): Prior probability representing our belief in the channel's performance before observing data.
-   P(data)P(\\text{data})P(data): Evidence, a normalizing constant.

### Steps for Analysis

1.  **Define Priors**: Represent initial beliefs about channel effectiveness, e.g., prior revenue or ROI distributions.
2.  **Set Up Likelihood Function**: Model the probability of observing data (e.g., revenue, impressions, conversions) for each channel.
3.  **Infer Posteriors**: Use PyMC to calculate the posterior distributions based on priors and observed data.
